            example: "Default: terms='UserService' finds IUserService, m_userService. Exact only: terms='UserService', substring=false",

        Tip {

        Tip {
            rule: "Language scope: content search = any language, AST = C# and TypeScript/TSX",
            why: "search_grep / content-index use a language-agnostic tokenizer -- works with any text file (C#, Rust, Python, JS, XML, etc.). search_definitions / def-index use tree-sitter AST parsing -- supports C# and TypeScript/TSX. search_callers uses call-graph analysis -- supports C# and TypeScript/TSX (DI-aware, inject() support, interface resolution).",
            example: "search grep works on -e rs,py,js,xml,json | search_definitions supports .cs, .ts, .tsx | search_callers supports .cs, .ts, .tsx",
        },
        Tip {
            rule: "Response truncation: large results are auto-capped at ~16KB",
            why: "Broad queries (short substring, common tokens) can return thousands of files. The server auto-truncates responses to ~16KB (~4K tokens) to avoid filling LLM context. summary.totalFiles always shows the FULL count. Use countOnly=true or narrow with dir/ext/exclude to get focused results.",
            example: "If responseTruncated=true appears, narrow your query: add ext, dir, excludeDir, or use countOnly=true. Server flag --max-response-kb adjusts the limit (0=unlimited).",

        Tip {
            rule: "Code health: find complex methods with includeCodeStats/sortBy/min*",

        Tip {
            rule: "Multi-term name in search_definitions: find ALL types in ONE call",

            example: "search_definitions name='UserService,IUserService,UserController' -> finds ALL matching definitions in one call",
        },
        Tip {
            rule: "Query budget: aim for 3 or fewer search calls per exploration task",
            why: "Each search call adds latency and LLM context. Use multi-term queries, includeBody, and combined filters to minimize round-trips. Most architecture questions can be answered in 1-3 calls.",
            example: "Step 1: search_definitions name='OrderService,IOrderService' includeBody=true (map + read). Step 2: search_callers method='ProcessOrder' class='OrderService' (call chain). Done in 2 calls.",
        },
        Tip {
            rule: "Check branch status before investigating production bugs",

            why: "Faster than search_git_history for finding the exact commit that added/deleted a specific string. Uses git log -S (exact) or -G (regex).",
            example: "MCP: search_git_pickaxe repo='.', text='ErrorMessage', file='src/Service.cs'",
        },
        Tip {
